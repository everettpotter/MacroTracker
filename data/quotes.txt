Stay hard.
Go one more.
The pain you feel today will be the strength you feel tomorrow.
Excellence is a habit, not an act.
One day, or Day one.
Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
Motivation gets you started, discipline keeps you going.
Fall in love with the journey, not the destination.
The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine.
If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you.
Pain is weakness leaving the body.
Remember who you are and what you represent.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Do what is easy and your life will be hard. Do what is hard and your life will become easy
Never let someone's opinion become your reality
You must be willing to do things today other's won't do, in order to have the things tomorrow others won't have
Don't underestimate yourself.
